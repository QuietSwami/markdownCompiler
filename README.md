# markdownCompiler

MarkdownCompiler is a convert from markdown to HTML.

## Why not use markdown2

[Markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) is a python library to convert markdown to HTML.
I decided to write my own as a way to practice, to build the foundation of my static website. Also, I will build in some extras, that need to be side loaded in the Markdown2 module.
There is a large probability that the Markdown2 is faster than this module, as this is not the main goal of this project.

## How to use it

TBD
